Hi! All my code is in the qmd file, including the function. The r script in the repo also contains the code for my function (but only that, the code for the final assignment is in the qmd file.
Here is the code for my function: 
daily_count<-function (n) {
	countee<-n
	return(table(final_project$`Health Workers Killed`== n))
}
daily_count(2)
daily_count(3)

I also included this code in my qmd file.
